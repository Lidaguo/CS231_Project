    "In this example, we do detection by a pure Caffe edition of the R-CNN model for ImageNet. The R-CNN detector outputs class scores for the 200 detection classes of ILSVRC13. Keep in mind that these are raw one vs. all SVM scores, so they are not probabilistically calibrated or exactly comparable across classes. Note that this off-the-shelf model is simply for convenience, and is not the full R-CNN model.\n",

    "Selective Search is the region proposer used by R-CNN. The selective_search_ijcv_with_python Python module takes care of extracting proposals through the selective search MATLAB implementation. To install it, download the module and name its directory selective_search_ijcv_with_python, run the demo in MATLAB to compile the necessary functions, then add it to your PYTHONPATH for importing. (If you have your own region proposals prepared, or would rather not bother with this step, detect.py accepts a list of images and bounding boxes as CSV.)\n",
